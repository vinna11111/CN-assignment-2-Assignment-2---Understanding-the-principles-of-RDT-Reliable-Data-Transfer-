 Reliable Data Transfer Protocols over UDP

This project implements Reliable Data Transfer (RDT) protocols at the application layer on top of the UDP transport protocol. Two classic ARQ-based protocols are developed and tested in a controlled network environment using Mininet.

ðŸ›  Features

1. Stop-and-Wait (rdt3.0)
	â€¢	Reliable transfer using sequence numbers and acknowledgements (ACKs).
	â€¢	Timeout and retransmission handling for packet loss.
	â€¢	Duplicate detection at the receiver.

2. Go-Back-N (GBN)
	â€¢	Sliding window protocol for pipelined data transfer.
	â€¢	Dynamic handling of different window sizes.
	â€¢	Improved throughput over Stop-and-Wait in low-delay environments.
